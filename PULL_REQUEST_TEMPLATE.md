# Important Notice

Patch submission and review is done through [Gerrit Code Review](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com).

If you really want to only use GitHub, you can submit your code as a Pull Request. We will take care of
importing the commit into Gerrit and the review will happen there.

__NO REVIEWS OR DISCUSSIONS will happen on GitHub__, all the code collaboration will take place on Gerrit.
