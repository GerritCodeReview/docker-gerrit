Patch submission and review is done through [Gerrit Code Review Issue Tracker](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/gerrit/issues/list).
Unfortunately, we cannot accept or follow-up other issues raised on GitHub because it is a read-only replica and is not monitored on a regular basis.

Thank you in advance for your understanding.
