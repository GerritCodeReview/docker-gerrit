      "message": "@luca.milanesio@gmail.com in my M1 it sometimes hangs on `amd64` platform build (during Gerrit init phase, but that happens all the time even if I use existing images) and I wonder if that will be the case for you. Later today I will give it a try on my ubuntu machine and will either fix anything if there is anything to fix or case `V+1` if it works (obviously I will tweak it to use locally built Gerrit packers as we have no multi-platform ready packages published in maven - notes section is mentioning it as a prerequisite).",
